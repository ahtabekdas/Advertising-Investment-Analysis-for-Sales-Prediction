# Advertising-Investment-Analysis-for-Sales-Prediction
In this project, we aim to answer the question of how much our sales figures increase when we invest in TV, radio, and newspaper advertising individually. We will analyze the impact of advertising spending on sales and determine which advertising method is more successful.

Using a dataset that includes sales data related to TV, radio, and newspaper advertisements, we will explore the correlation between advertising investments and sales. Additionally, we will visualize our predictions using a line chart to compare them with the actual test data.
